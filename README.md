# Travel Quizz

In this read.me file you are going to find out a few things about my project. 

## Feautures 

My project is a simple yet tidy one-page website that gives you a travel destination suggestion based on the questions answered. 
After answering each question and pressing on the "next" button, the user is being sent to the next question. The final answer is a hand picked suggestion, based on the combination of answers that the users selects.

### Validator Testing

    ## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub) 

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
