# Travel Quizz

In this read.me file you are going to find out a few things about my project. 

## Feautures 

My project is a simple yet tidy one-page website that gives you a travel destination suggestion based on the questions answered. 
After answering each question and pressing on the "next" button, the user is being sent to the next question. The final answer is a hand picked suggestion, based on the combination of answers that the users selects.
